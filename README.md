# alabama-covid-19-tracker
A web tracker of the COVID-19 disease progression in Alabama, USA. (Work in Progress)

## Synopsis

Alabama COVID-19 Tracker is a web application that tracks the progression of the diesease in the state of Alabama. Data for the tracker comes from [Alabama Department of Health's website](http://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/infectiousdiseases/2019-coronavirus.html).

## Motivation

I have been following the coronavirus outbreak with morbid fascination since late January. 

In that time, I have used [worldometer's COVID-19 Coronavirus Outbreak dashboard](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) and [John Hopkins' Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases dashboard](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) for my daily updates. When the Alabama Department of Health started to share daily updates, I got the idea it would be neat to create a graphical representation of the data, which at the time, only existed in tabular formaat.

Since my idea for the project, the Alabama Department of Health has shared their official dashboard for tracking the diease's progression in Alabama. [You can view it here](https://alpublichealth.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/6d2771faa9da4a2786a509d82c8cf0f7).

This almost killed my motivation for pursuing the project, but my secondary goal was to use this as a learning project. Specifically, I had two goals:

1. Write my first web scraper
2. Learn Go by creating a web service

### Why Alabama?

Well, because I live here and it hits close to home.
